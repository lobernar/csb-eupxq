 <h1>Introduction</h1>
 <p>In this report, we will present the Voronoi diagrams, 
        their applications and how to compute them.
    In particular, we will analyse how different types of
         distances affect the shape of Voronoi diagrams. We will also
         talk about L<sub>p</sub> norms and their inducted distances.
    <br>
    Finally, we will present the web application we developed that was used to do the analysis.
 </p>

 <h1>Voronoi diagrams</h1>
  <p>
        Voronoi diagrams are used in many fields of study such as in computational geometry for representing problems, in robotics for detecting an 
        object or in geography for the study of patterns and urban settlements. When considering the Euclidean plane, such diagrams can be used to
        solve problems such as the all-nearest-neighbors problem, the Euclidean minimum spanning tree problem, Knuth’s post-office problem, the
        largest empty circle problem, and other seemingly unrelated problems in O(nlogn) time complexity for n sites, as shown by Shamos and Hoey [7].
  </p>
  <p>Voronoi diagrams are defined as a set of points or sites <i>S</i> which partition the plane into regions. For each site <i>p</i> there is a corresponding
    region R(p, S), called a Voronoi cell, consisting of all points of the plane closer to p 
    than to any other site. If there are n sites, there will be n regions containing one site per region.
    There is another approach which consists of defining a Voronoi diagram using a set of bisecting curves, but in our 
    case these diagrams are defined by a set of points. <br>
    Of course the distance function is essential for the construction of the
    Voronoi diagram, so using different functions will result in different diagrams. In [1] Chew and Drysdalc discussed Voronoi diagrams 
    based on convex distance functions. Voronoi diagrams are defined by Dobrin [5] as follows:
        <ul> 
            <li>Voronoi regions should be path-connected</li>
            <li>The union of the Voronoi regions should cover the whole plane</li>
            <li>Any two bisector curves should intersect only finitely often</li>
        </ul>
        Some other properties of Voronoi diagrams are:
        <ul>
            <li> Each vertex has degree at least three and corresponds to 
                        the intersection of the bisecting curves </li>
            <li>Using Euler's formula, we can say that there are at most 2n-5 vertices and 3n-6 edges </li>
        </ul>
        Klein in [6] and [2] defined a new class of Voronoi diagrams called <i> abstract Voronoi diagrams</i>. He showed that such diagrams can be
        computed without the last property. Later Mehlhorn, Meiser and Dúnlaing [3] proved that there is a O(nlogn) 
        randomized algorithm for constructing (a subset of Klein's) abstract Voronoi diagrams. Unfortunately abstract Voronoi diagrams
        are not based on a distance measure but on systems of simple curves which bisect the plane. So we will not talk about this family
        of diargams.
    </p>
    <h3>Duality</h3>
    <p> 
        The dual problem of the Voronoi diagrams is
         the Delaunay triangulation. 
         The Delaunay triangulation for a given set P of discrete
          points in a general position is a triangulation DT(P) 
          such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle
           of any triangle in DT(P).
         <br>
         We could use this triangulation to compute the corresponding Voronoi diagram. 
         If two triangles share an edge in the Delaunay triangulation, their 
         circumcenters are to be connected with an edge in the Voronoi diagram. This is 
         done by finding a circle such that at least 3 points of the Delaunay triangulation are on it's border. 
         If this is the case, then the center of the circle is a Voronoi vertex. 
    </p>

<h2>Nice metrics</h2>
<p> Voronoi diagrams are usually computed using 
    the euclidean distance but it is interesting
     to see what happens when using another distance which respects some properties. Here we will only focus on <i>nice metrics</i>. To be nice, a metric <i>d</i> 
     has to have the following properties:
     <ol>
         <li>the metric induces an Euclidean topology</li>
         <li>the d-circles are bounded with respect to the Euclidean metric</li>
         <li>given 2 points <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, there exists a point <i>b</i> &ne; {a,c}, such that d(a,c)=d(a,b) + d(b,c)</li>
         <li>The intersection of two bisector curves J(p, q), J(p, r) consists of only finitely
            many connected components</li>
    </ol>
    Every distances inducted by an L<sub>p</sub> norm has those properties. Another example of a nice metric is the Moscow metric which is detailed in [4].
    <br>
    If d is a nice metric, then each region of the diagram are path connected and have a non-empty interior.
</p>
<p> 
    The formula used to compute the L<sub>p</sub> norm in &reals;<sup>k</sup> is: (&sum;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>k</sup> |a<sub>i</sub>|<sup>p</sup>)<sup>1/p</sup> <br>
    Given a norm (w), the inducted distance between two points (x and y)
    always exists and
     is defined as: d(x, y) = w (x-y) <br>
    In the case where the user wants to compute the L<sub>&infin;</sub> norm, the formula used to compute the inducted distance between two points <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
    is the equivalent Chebyshev formula: max<sub>i&in;k</sub>(|x<sub>i</sub>-y<sub>i</sub>|).
    
</p>

<h1>Algorithms</h1>
    <p>There exist many algorithms to compute the Voronoi diagrams. We will focus on 2 of them and briefly mention
        the divide and conquer technique.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that in this project, we implemented only the brute force algorithm because
        we were not looking for performance but instead we analyzed how the different
        types of distances influence the shape of the Voronoi diagrams.
    </p>

<h2>Brute force algorithm</h2>
    <p>
        The brute force algorithm runs in O(p*n) where p is the number of pixels and n is the number of sites. 
    </p>
    <p>The idea is pretty simple,
        we go through every pixel, compute the nearest site and color it accordingly.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        We implemented a slightly different version of this brute force algorithm.
         We grouped pixels by squares of dimension s (e.g s = 5)
         in order to compute the nearest site of a group of the pixel instead
         of for each pixel.
        
        With this approach the time complexity is: O((p/s&sup2;)*n).
    </p>
    
    
<h2>Fortune's algorithm</h2>
    <p>The most famous algorithm to compute a Voronoi diagram
         is called Fortune's algorithm which runs in O(nlogn) time complexity
        where n is the number of sites. 
        It is way more complex than the brute force algorithm and therefore difficult to understand. The idea behind it is to use:
        <ul>
            <li> a sweepline which sweeps the set of sites from top to bottom to separate the processed and unprocessed sites.</li>
            <li> a beach line which creates a new parabolic arc every time the sweepline encounters a new site. These arcs grow
                wider as the sweepline moves. It's purpose is to keep track of the break points (intersection of two arcs).</li>
            <li> events to handle every time the sweepline meets a site or when a break point from the beachline occurs.</li>
        </ul>
    The needed data structures are the following:
    <ul>
        <li>a doubly connected edge list to keep track of the incomplete Voronoi diagram,</li>
        <li>a binary tree for the state of the beachline, and</li>
        <li>a priority queue for the events.</li> 
    </ul>
    Every time an event is handled, the doubly connected edge list and the queue are modified, and the algorithm halts when the queue is 
    empty.
    </p>

<h2>Divide and conquer algorithm</h2>
<p>
There is another interesting approach which is the divide and
 conquer approach introduced by Shamos and Hoey [7].
 Unfortunately we could not use it because
  it does not work with distances that are not convex.
   But is nonetheless important to mention it because
    it also runs in O(nlogn) time complexity.
<br>
<!--The main idea of this algorithm is to make a partition
 of the space every time in 4 zones that are a retangular.
  If all the extreme points of a zone has the same nearest site
   then all the entire zone has as nearest site that one. 
   If the previous condition is not meet then algorithm continue to devide the zone
    by doing a 4-partition recursively. -->
    The main idea of the algorithm is to divide the set of sites into 2 sets of the same
    size, the left set and the right set. Once this is done, we compute the Voronoi 
    diagram of the two sets V(L) and V(R) recursively and merge these.
</p>
<p>
There are many different implementations and ideas for the divide and conquer technique, 
another one is detailed by Smith, Trefftz and DeVries [8].

</p>

<h1>The App</h1>
 <p>
    To better explain how the different types of distances affect the Voronoi diagrams we developed
         a <a href="index.html">web application</a> that you can use
          and play with it.
 </p>
 <h3>How to use it</h3>
 <p>
    The user needs to enter a set of points and choose 
    a definition of a distance to generate the Voronoi diagrams.
 </p>

 <p>
    In order to choose a type of distance the user need to enter a value (p).
    This value defines a distance inducted by the norm L<sub>p</sub>.
    In the case the value entered as p is not valid
    then its value will be 2 by default.
    <br>
    In order to give the set of points the user needs to click on the screen. He will see points of 
    different colors appear on the screen which represent the sites of the Voronoi diagram. 
    After that, by clicking on the central button the Voronoi diagram will be drawn.
    In case the user wants to use the distance induced by the norm L<sub>&infin;</sub>,
     instead of clicking on the central button he can use the "Chebyshev" button.
 </p>

 <h1>Analysis</h1>
 <p>
    To analyze the results, we created 17 random points and computed the Voronoi diagram using 
    different L<sub>p</sub> norms. We used the Manhattan distance, the Euclidean distance
     and the distance implied by norm L<sub>3</sub>. The results are shown in the images below.<br>
    We can see that for the same set of points, different results occur.
     One interesting observation is that when using the Euclidean distance,
      every region is convex but this is not always true when using other type of distances.<br>
    Another result is that for the Euclidean distance the Voronoi
     edges are straight lines but for 
    other cases, the edges are not straight.<br>
    Note that for our tests we computed the Voronoi diagrams
     using the brute force algorithm by grouping the pixels by squares
      of size 3.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
    From what we observed in the analysis, we can say that, as stated before, the shape of the Voronoi
    diagram changes depending on which distances was used. It is interesting to see how the curves
    change from one formula to another.<br> 
    Another exercice would be to take our idea and implement Fortune's algorithm to compute a more 
    precise diagram than with our brute force approach. We could set the size of the squares to 1
    but the computation would take a really long time since it has to go through every pixel. Unfortunately
    the remaining time did not allow us to do that.
